# Prospective Hockey Modeling

This repository demonstrates a streamlined approach to building and analyzing predictive models for hockey games. While the foundation of this project is shared here, some proprietary details and betting strategies remain private.

## Overview

- **Data Pipeline**: Demonstrates how basic hockey data is collected, stored, and pre-processed.
- **Modeling Approach**: Outlines the general machine learning or statistical techniques used for predictive analysis.
- **Sample Results**: Provides a high-level look at model outputs and performance metrics (win probabilities, expected goals, etc.).

## Why This Project?

The goal is to showcase practical skills in data engineering, model development, and hockey-specific analytics. It serves as a partial portfolio piece for employers and collaborators, illustrating real-world sports analytics concepts without exposing all trade secrets.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository** (or fork it) to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/prospective-hockey-modeling.git
   ```

2. **Install Requirements** (if provided):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore** the example notebooks or scripts in the `analysis` folder. These examples show selected steps in the workflow, from data ingestion to modeling outputs.

## What’s Included

- **Sample Data** (limited and anonymized).
- **Partial Scripts** for data cleaning, basic feature engineering, and a simple model outline.
- **Read-Only Results** showcasing example predictions and performance metrics.

## What’s Not Included

- **Full Betting Strategy** details and advanced logic are proprietary, kept separate from this public repository.
- **Complete Datasets** or sensitive data sources used for real-world betting insights.

## Future Work

- Refined modeling techniques for improved predictive power.
- Extended datasets with richer features (private).
- Ongoing performance tracking and error analysis.

## Contributing

This project isn’t actively seeking external contributions at the moment. However, if you have suggestions or questions, feel free to open an issue.
